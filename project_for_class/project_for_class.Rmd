This is from the [first chapter](http://learn.r-journalism.com/en/how_to_use_r/project_for_class/class-project/) of [learn.r-journalism.com](https://learn.r-journalism.com/).

How to a) get the files needed for each chapter in class and b) how to follow along with each chapter/code through.

## Getting files and folders

The files for this class will include the raw data, the scripts, and r markdown files.

There are a few options to download them:

### 1) Install the package I've created for this class

Each chapter has a prompt to download the files assocaited with each one. 

Hopefully, you've created a folder on your computer in your `Documents` folder called `learning-r` or something like that.

Once you've set your working directory (with maybe `setwd()`) then you can run these commands in your console to download the correct folders and data:

```{r install2, eval=F}
install.packages("usethis")

# This is for chapter 2 files and folders

usethis::use_course("https://github.com/r-journalism/learn-chapter-2/archive/master.zip")

```

### 2) Download the entire repo off Github

Each repo that begins with `learn-chapter-X` has files and folders for each chapter we're going through. You can clone or repo each one and open the .Rproj file in each of those folders to follow along.

### 3) Follow from scratch

Alternatively, you could create the files yourself from scratch with the correct folder structure. This is pretty tough for beginners but useful to really understand how project and folder structures work.

* Create a new project in RStudio right now and call it learning-r-journalism
* Save all your scripts and your data into here for now (ideally with an organized folder structure)
* Data referenced in each chapter/sub-chapter can be downloaded individually from their respective repos 
    * create new folders following the structure of the code in each walkthrough and place data downloaded from the repos as indicated

## Following the code through

Each subchapter has a **.Rmd** file that contains the scripted code for each walkthrough.

This is an R Markdown file, which we will explain in detail in chapter 6.

But for now, the important thing to understand is that it's a mix of markdown text and R code.

The R code sections are indicated by the grayed out areas.

Each section can be executed with the green triangle button on the right.

If you get an error, it might be because you didn't run a chunk of code above. This is essentially an R script broken up into pieces and separated by text. Code depends on code executing above it successfully.

Here's how to run code above a current chunk:

## The ideal way to follow along

Do as much manually as you can.

After you get the files and folders, open a new script file and write out the code written in each video and subchapter codethrough.

Avoid just running code chunks in R Markdown.

Avoid copying and pasting the code.

Avoid passively learning.

Manually typing out your code starts the muscle memory and problem solving training.

**That being said**, if you get stuck, use that code that I've provided however you want.
