<p>The files for this class will include the raw data, the scripts, and r markdown files.</p>
<p>There are a few options to download them:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download the entire repo off Github</li>
<li>Install the package I’ve created for this class</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;)
devtools::install_github(&quot;andrewbtran/lrj&quot;)</code></pre>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Follow the directions at the top of each following classes to install</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>library(lrj)
install_chapter(1)</code></pre>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Or create the files yourself from scratch the correct folder structure
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in RStudio right now and call it learning-r-journalism</li>
<li>Save all your scripts and your data into here for now (ideally with an organized folder structure)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Even if the script with the correct exists on this website and in the downloaded files, type as much of the code I describe in the videos and on this site yourself.</p>
<p>Avoid copying and pasting the code because you’re passively learning.</p>
<p>Do as much manually as you can. This starts the muscle memory and problem solving training.</p>
<p>That being said, if you get stuck, all the scripts and code and proper folder structure is available to download.</p>
